# NOTES: This will build the quasi-mapping-based index, using an auxiliary k-mer hash over k-mers of length 31.
# While quasi-mapping will make used of arbitrarily long matches between the query and reference, the k size selected
# here will act as the minimum acceptable length for a valid match. Thus, a smaller value of k may slightly improve
# sensitivty. We find that a k of 31 seems to work well for reads of 75bp or longer, but you might consider a smaller
# k if you plan to deal with shorter reads.
